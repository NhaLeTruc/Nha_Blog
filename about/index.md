Living involves series of decisions. For the majority of us, these decisions are relatively easy. When and how to workout, eat, sleep, work, socialize, fall in love, etc are trivia and often take for granted. Despite the fact that we all have to experience a great deal, before we could make those decisions with relative ease and confidence. On top of that, our daily routines rarely deviate from the norm, hence our relatively high success rate with our daily tasks. Once we work together, however, is when decision making become an juggling act. The group tasks often involve much larger scale; scope and other moving parts. Anything could go wrong at any given moment even with the best of intentions. Enter data science, the rational art of making sense of the unknown, the unseen and the unfathomable by the human senses and experiences. At Dataphile, you will find a collection of full-length articles and mini blogs dedicated to this exciting field.
