#Basic Data Analysis with RStudio: ANOVA 

ANOVA – Analysis of variance is the most basic form of statistical analysis, but also one of most useful especially for beginners. I will not go too much into details on how the theory and technical aspect of this analysis works, as you could find plenty of resources everywhere. Instead, a pragmatic guide on how to use this type of analysis will be the main focus of this article. An important note to remember, so you wouldn’t sound silly later. ANOVA is actually a family of analysis. For example, there are ANOVA for one dependent variable and for multiple variables. Today, we will look into one-way analysis of variance, or one-way ANOVA.

So when do you use ANOVA? The analysis of variance is used to measure the differences between two or more groups. Let say you have 3 teams which work on similar projects at your firm. You want to determine what characteristic(s) of these teams make them effective at their job. Normally you would wait for the results to come out, then decide that the best perform team is the model for the rest to mimic. The next time you build a team, you decide to select people with the characteristics of the last teams that you think make them successful. Obviously, these characteristics are biased virtues which were given significance due to their contribution to your past experiences. Now gut feelings aren’t entirely bad, human brain is actually very good at predicting thing that it’s familiar with. But, your brain chemicals are quite volatile and may be affected by external forces. Plus, past experiences may become irrelevant as situations involve.

Hence the need for analysis like ANOVA. The analysis doesn’t replace you, it helps you. Say you believe big bonuses motivate people to work harder. Using ANOVA, you could scientifically prove that your assumption is true. First you would need is a good amount of data (larger than 40 observations) spread over at least 2 years for three groups working on similar tasks. The first group receive big bonuses monthly; the second receive significantly lower bonuses and the third receive nothing at month’s end will act as control. 

Notice that when using one-way ANOVA you need 2 variables. One independent variable, in this case it’s the bonuses’ sizes. One dependent variable in this case it’s the performance level of the group. Our underline assumption is the independent variable could predict the dependent variable. The independent variables need to have at least 2 levels or classifications. In our case, they are big bonus, low bonus and no bonus. The group receive no stimulation from your independent variable in question, the control group, is crucial to your experiment’s creditability, so always have one in your studies. 

Next, like any other statistical analysis, ANOVA has assumptions. Assumptions are conditions you have to meet before you use the statistical tool on your data. For ANOVA they are:

*	Each sample is an independent random sample.- Select your observations randomly, after you have removed outliners (stuff that most likely resulted from abnormal influences)
*	The distribution of the response variable follows a normal distribution. – This is a given for any study of this kind. The only thing you need to make sure is that the groups in question perform the same tasks; and except from the independent variable’s levels; are similar in as many ways as possible.
*	The population variances are equal across responses for the group levels. – Same as the second assumption.

Finally, the default hypothesis aka null hypothesis of all ANOVA is that the means of all the groups are equal or === code ===. Since the point of ANOVA is to prove this hypothesis to be wrong. Typically, your assumption will be the opposite of this null hypothesis. Like in our case, our assumption is that the mean or average outputs of each groups significantly differ. And we hope that the group with bigger bonus will produce more outputs. 

So let say this is your two years dataset:

=== table of data ===

Note that the number of observations between groups don’t need to be equal. But recommend that it’s larger than 4, and not too dwarfed (twice larger is acceptable but no more) by any other group’s size. These are just rules of thumb. They would vary from different sources to another.
You now need to prepare your dataset. First we assign the groups’ id as factors or categorical data in R, instead of numerical. This is to tell R we measuring 3 groups in this case, and they are our independent variable’s levels. The team performance is measure in units of outputs, think of it as anything you like dollars; shoes; applications; teddy bears; etc. This measure is our dependent variable and should be continuous numerical data. Finally, put the two vectors (think of them as Excel column equivalent) into a data frame, this is the equivalent of spreadsheet in R.

=== code ===

The attach() function enables you to use the two variables ‘group_id’and ‘#units_of_outputs’ in the global environment of R. That means you could type: 

=== code ===

Instead of 

=== code ===

In order to use these two variables. This might be an example of how lazy developers are. They are, but as you write larger scripts this function become real handy. 

Finally we come to the moment we have waited for. The actual code that will perform ANOVA for us and give us a hint whether our assumption, bonus make people work harder is likely to be true.

=== code ===

That’s it! Search the formulas to perform this one-way analysis of variance, and you will be impressed. Now come the difficult part, understanding the result.

=== code ===

It is sufficient for you to only notice the number of stars on the rightmost of the result table. Three stars mean your assumption may held some water. Anything less then you should either measure some more data and/or choose a different assumption to test. 
But if you want to know how different the groups are from each other. Use this code:

=== code ===

The result would be:

=== code ===

Again the stars will be the indication of significant difference with groups’ average values. The first group is renamed as (Intercept). Since it is compared to other groups in turn. If this line have stars, it means at least one other group of your experiment has different mean. That group will also have stars on its line of code. 

Notice that we do not used the words “confirms” or “denies”. True statisticians would never use such words to describe their findings. As statistics don’t deal fact, it’s all about probability and confidence. We are like a bunch of mathematical politicians. But fear not, most of the most important and successful human endeavours have found these type of tools indispensable. You only need to see it as a friend who is saying “Hey, may be your assumption is correct, but we don’t have enough proofs right now. You might want to collect more data or investigate more assumptions. We might learn something later or elsewhere. Don’t give up ok”. Thus, you could feel slightly more confidence reduce or increase bonus for your teams. You could repeat this experiment with different levels of bonus, to see where performance stop raising as fast as bonus.
